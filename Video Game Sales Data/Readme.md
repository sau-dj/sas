I loaded the videogamesales dataset into SAS and initially built a regression model with numeric predictors. To improve the model fit, I incorporated categorical predictors like rating, genre, and platform by creating dummy variables. I systematically evaluated including additional predictors and interaction terms by adding them to the model.

My final model included numeric variables, dummies for categories, and interaction terms between critic/user counts with categories. After arriving at the final model, I checked for violations: I identified outliers using metrics like Cook's D and re-ran the model excluding them. I checked for multicollinearity using VIF, dropping highly correlated variables. I verified lack of heteroscedasticity using White's test and checked normality assumptions using residual plots. Finally, I interpreted the coefficients of significant predictors and interactions in the corrected final model.
